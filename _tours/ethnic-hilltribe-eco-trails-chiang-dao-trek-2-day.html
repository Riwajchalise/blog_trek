  Please note that trails and stops may change due to weather and seasonal

  simple and not luxurious but on this trail it is more comfortable than our
  other trails. But please do not expect hotel standards in a homestay. The
  local dance show is mostly on Saturdays and Sundays sometimes in the week
  during high season. If the children don't come to preform it means they are
  busy with other activities.
